# Data Analysis Portfolio
###### Hello and welcome to my Github Portfolio page. My name is Antonia Callisto and I am excited share with you some interesting projects I have been exceptionally pleased to work on. 
###### In this repository you will come across several subfolders and folders that demonstrate but are not limited to the following skills I have obtained in data: data collection (with api's), data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, data visualisation, machine learning etc. 
###### Most of my projects are conducted using the Python as my preferred programming language in Jupyter Notebooks and mostly utlise Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras & Py Torch. 
In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Letâ€™s get started!
