In this repository you will come across several subfolders and folders that demonstrate but are not limited to the following skills I have obtained in data: data collection (with api's), data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, data visualisation, machine learning etc. 

Most of my projects are conducted using Python as my preferred programming language with the use of Jupyter Notebooks.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my interests and a brief description of the projects you will find in each folder. Letâ€™s get started!
